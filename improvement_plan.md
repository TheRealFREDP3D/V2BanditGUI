# BanditGUI Improvement Plan

## 1. Summary of Current State

BanditGUI is an interactive web-based terminal application designed to help users learn cybersecurity through the OverTheWire Bandit wargame. It features a split-screen interface with a live SSH terminal connected to the Bandit servers and an AI mentor system. The project utilizes FastAPI for the backend, handling WebSocket connections for the terminal and an AI mentor powered by Ollama. The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using XTerm.js for terminal emulation.

During the review, the repository was successfully cloned, dependencies were installed, and the application was run. The basic functionality of the terminal and the 


AI mentor was tested. The initial attempt to run the application failed due to a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `paramiko`, which was resolved by reinstalling dependencies. A critical issue identified was a `Mixed Content` error in the browser console related to the WebSocket connection, where the frontend was attempting to connect over `ws://` while the page was loaded over `https://`. This was addressed by changing the WebSocket protocol to `wss://` in `static/js/terminal.js`.

## 2. Identified Issues and Proposed Solutions

### 2.1 WebSocket Protocol Mismatch

**Issue:** The frontend `static/js/terminal.js` was attempting to establish a WebSocket connection using `ws://` (unsecured WebSocket protocol) while the application was being served over `https://` (secured HTTP protocol). This resulted in a `Mixed Content` error, preventing the WebSocket connection from being established and thus rendering the terminal non-functional.

**Proposed Solution:** The issue was resolved by modifying the WebSocket connection URL in `static/js/terminal.js` to use `wss://` (secured WebSocket protocol). This ensures that the WebSocket connection adheres to the security context of the parent page, allowing the terminal to function correctly.

### 2.2 `paramiko` Module Not Found

**Issue:** Upon the first attempt to run the application after cloning and installing dependencies, a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'paramiko'` was encountered. This indicated that the `paramiko` library, a crucial dependency for SSH connectivity, was not correctly installed or accessible within the Python environment.

**Proposed Solution:** The issue was resolved by explicitly reinstalling the dependencies using `uv pip install -r requirements.txt` after activating the virtual environment. This ensured that all required packages, including `paramiko`, were properly installed and linked within the project's virtual environment.

### 2.3 General Areas for Improvement (from `docs/v0.1-project_overview.md`)

The `docs/v0.1-project_overview.md` file outlines several areas for improvement, categorized by priority. These areas represent technical debt and potential enhancements to the BanditGUI project.

#### 2.3.1 Immediate (High Priority)

*   **Error Handling:** The current implementation has limited error handling, especially in WebSocket connections. Robust error handling is crucial for application stability and user experience. This includes handling SSH connection failures, WebSocket disconnections, and unexpected data. 
    *   **Proposed Solution:** Implement comprehensive `try-except` blocks around critical operations, particularly SSH connections and WebSocket communication. Implement specific error messages and logging to aid in debugging and user feedback. Consider adding client-side error handling to gracefully manage disconnections and provide informative messages to the user.

*   **Graceful WebSocket Disconnect Handling:** The application needs to gracefully handle WebSocket disconnections to prevent abrupt termination of the terminal session and provide a better user experience. 
    *   **Proposed Solution:** Implement `onclose` and `onerror` event handlers for the WebSocket connection on the frontend to detect disconnections. On the backend, ensure that SSH connections are properly closed when a WebSocket disconnects. Consider implementing a reconnection mechanism on the frontend.

*   **Missing Environment File Template:** The documentation mentions a missing `.env.example` file, which is essential for proper environment configuration. 
    *   **Proposed Solution:** (Already addressed during the review by copying `.env.example` to `.env`). Ensure that the `.env.example` file is always present and up-to-date in the repository, providing clear instructions on how to configure environment variables.

*   **Setup Documentation:** The project lacks comprehensive setup instructions. 
    *   **Proposed Solution:** Enhance the `README.md` with detailed, step-by-step instructions for setting up the development environment, installing dependencies, configuring Ollama, and running the application. Include troubleshooting tips for common issues.

#### 2.3.2 Short Term (Medium Priority)

*   **Logging System:** A robust logging system is essential for monitoring application health, debugging issues, and tracking user activity. 
    *   **Proposed Solution:** Integrate a standard Python logging library (e.g., `logging`) into the FastAPI application. Configure logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) and output destinations (console, file). Log important events such as SSH connection attempts, AI mentor requests, and errors.

*   **Connection Retry Logic:** The current SSH connection mechanism lacks retry logic, which can lead to connection failures in unstable network environments. 
    *   **Proposed Solution:** Implement a retry mechanism for SSH connections with exponential backoff. This will make the application more resilient to transient network issues and improve the reliability of terminal sessions.

*   **Health Checks for External Services:** The application relies on external services like Ollama. Health checks are needed to ensure these services are operational. 
    *   **Proposed Solution:** Implement a health check endpoint for Ollama within the FastAPI application. This endpoint can periodically ping the Ollama API to verify its availability. If Ollama is unavailable, the application can provide appropriate feedback to the user.

*   **CHANGELOG.md:** The documentation requests a `CHANGELOG.md` file. 
    *   **Proposed Solution:** Create and maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` file to document all significant changes, new features, bug fixes, and improvements in a clear and chronological manner.

#### 2.3.3 Long Term (Low Priority)

*   **User Session Management:** The application currently lacks user session management, which limits its ability to personalize user experience or track progress. 
    *   **Proposed Solution:** Implement a session management system, potentially using FastAPI's built-in session capabilities or an external library. This would allow for features like user authentication, persistent settings, and personalized learning paths.

*   **Progress Tracking:** Tracking user progress through the Bandit wargame would enhance the learning experience. 
    *   **Proposed Solution:** Integrate a mechanism to track user progress, such as completed levels or challenges. This could involve storing progress data locally or in a database.

*   **More AI Models/Providers:** The current AI mentor is limited to Ollama/Qwen2.5:1.5b. 
    *   **Proposed Solution:** Explore integrating other AI models or providers (e.g., Gemini API as mentioned in `config.py`) to offer users more choices and potentially better performance or different mentor personalities.

*   **Automated Testing:** The project currently lacks automated tests, which can lead to regressions and make future development challenging. 
    *   **Proposed Solution:** Implement unit tests for individual components (e.g., `mentor.py`, `config.py`) and integration tests for the FastAPI endpoints and WebSocket communication. Use a testing framework like `pytest`.

## 3. Implementation Plan

Based on the identified issues and proposed solutions, the following implementation plan is recommended:
